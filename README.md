- Supports complicated peer-dependencies
- Optional support for TypeScript

- Thorough documentation :heart_eyes:

## Install globally

This package requires `node >= 5`, but we recommend `node >= 8`.

```bash
npm install -g @node/create-library
```

## Usage with npx

```bash
npx @node/create-library
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

## Creating a New Module

```bash
@node/create-library
```

Answer some basic prompts about your module, and then the CLI will perform the following steps:

- copy over the template
- install dependencies via yarn or npm
- link packages together for local development
- initialize local git repo

At this point, your new module should resemble this screenshot and is all setup for local development.

## Development

Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.

```bash
npm start # runs rollup with watch flag
```

The second part will be running the `example/` that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab)
cd example
npm start # runs node index.js
```

#### Publishing to npm

```bash
npm publish
```

This builds `cjs` and `es` versions of your module to `dist/` and then publishes your module to `npm`.

Make sure that any npm modules you want as peer dependencies are properly marked as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. The rollup config will automatically recognize them as peers and not try to bundle them in your module.
